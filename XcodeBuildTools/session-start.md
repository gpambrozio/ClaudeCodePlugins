# Xcode Build Tools Plugin

The `XcodeBuildTools` plugin provides specialized tools for Xcode build and test. Use these capabilities appropriately:

## Building, Testing & Compilation

**IMPORTANT**: Whenever you need to build or test an Xcode project/workspace, compile or test Swift packages, or anytime you would use `swift`/`xcodebuild` commands, **always** use the `xcodebuild` skill instead. This skill provides token-efficient, AI-friendly compilation output.

## Documentation

The `sosumi` MCP server provides quick access to Apple's official documentation for Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and other frameworks. Use it for new APIs or to verify the correct parameters.
