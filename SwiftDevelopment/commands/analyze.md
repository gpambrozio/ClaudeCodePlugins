# Swift Code Analysis

Perform a comprehensive analysis of Swift code in the current project, including:

- Architecture patterns (MVC, MVVM, VIPER, etc.)
- Common Swift anti-patterns and code smells
- Memory management issues (retain cycles, strong references)
- SwiftUI best practices violations
- Unused imports and dead code
- Force unwrapping and optional handling
- Protocol conformance opportunities

Provide a summary of findings with file locations and severity levels (critical, warning, suggestion).
