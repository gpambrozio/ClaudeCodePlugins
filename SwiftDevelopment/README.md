# SwiftDevelopment Plugin

A Claude Code plugin for Swift and iOS development workflows, providing MCP servers and slash commands to streamline your development process.

## Installation

1. Link this plugin to your Claude Code plugins directory:
   ```bash
   claude plugins add /path/to/ClaudeCodePlugins/SwiftDevelopment
   ```

2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   claude plugins list
   ```

## Features

This plugin provides:
- **Code Analysis**: Comprehensive Swift code analysis with `/analyze` command
- **Swift Compilation**: Token-efficient xcodebuild and swift command wrappers with xcsift
- **2 MCP Servers**: ios-simulator and apple-docs integration
- **Extensible Structure**: Ready for custom skills and agents

## Slash Commands

### `/analyze`

Performs comprehensive analysis of Swift code in your project:
- Architecture pattern detection
- Anti-pattern identification
- Memory management issues (retain cycles, strong references)
- SwiftUI best practices violations
- Unused imports and dead code
- Force unwrapping and optional handling
- Protocol conformance opportunities

Provides a summary of findings with file locations and severity levels (critical, warning, suggestion).

## Skills

### swift-compile

Provides token-efficient wrappers for `xcodebuild` and `swift` commands using [xcsift](https://github.com/ldomaradzki/xcsift) to parse output into JSON format, dramatically reducing verbosity for AI coding agents.

**Usage**: Claude will automatically use these wrappers when building or testing Swift projects. The skill:
- Intercepts `xcodebuild` and `swift` commands
- Parses compiler output into structured JSON
- Reports errors and warnings concisely
- Auto-installs xcsift via Homebrew if needed

**Examples**:
```bash
# Build a workspace
~/.claude/plugins/SwiftDevelopment/skills/swift-compile/scripts/xcodebuild.sh \
  -workspace Project.xcworkspace -scheme ProjectScheme build

# Test a Swift package
cd PackageFolder
~/.claude/plugins/SwiftDevelopment/skills/swift-compile/scripts/swift.sh test
```

## MCP Servers

This plugin includes two integrated MCP servers for comprehensive iOS development:

### ios-simulator

Control iOS Simulator directly from Claude Code:
- Launch apps on simulator
- Take screenshots
- Manage device states
- Streamline mobile development workflows

**Package**: `ios-simulator-mcp`

### apple-docs

Access Apple's official documentation:
- Search Swift API documentation
- Find iOS framework references
- Look up SwiftUI component documentation
- Access best practices and guides

**Package**: `@kimsungwhee/apple-docs-mcp@latest`

### Adding More MCP Servers

To add additional MCP servers, edit `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "your-package@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Adding New Commands

1. Create a new `.md` file in `commands/`
2. Write the command prompt in markdown
3. The filename becomes the command name (e.g., `my-command.md` â†’ `/my-command`)

### Adding Skills

1. Create a new directory in `skills/` with your skill name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with the skill definition
3. Skills are automatically available to Claude agents

### Adding Agents

1. Create a new `.md` file in `agents/`
2. Define the agent's behavior and tools
3. Agents can be invoked for specialized tasks

## Contributing

When adding new features:
- Update this README
- Follow Swift naming conventions
- Test commands in real projects
- Document any new MCP server requirements
