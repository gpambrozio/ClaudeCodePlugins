# Swift & iOS Development Plugin

The `SwiftDevelopment` plugin provides specialized tools for Swift and iOS development. Use these capabilities appropriately:

## Building, Testing & Compilation

**IMPORTANT**: Whenever you need to build or test an Xcode project/workspace, compile or test Swift packages, or anytime you would use `swift`/`xcodebuild` commands, **always** use the `swift-compile` skill instead. This skill provides token-efficient, AI-friendly compilation output.

## Code Analysis

Use the `/analyze` command for comprehensive Swift code analysis including:

## iOS Simulator Control

The `ios-simulator` MCP server is available for:
- Launching and managing simulator instances
- Taking screenshots
- Installing and running apps
- Managing device states

## Apple Documentation

The `apple-docs` MCP server provides quick access to Apple's official documentation for Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and other frameworks. Use it for new APIs and to verify the correct parameters.
